# Data: wind electricity supply shocks 

I include here different versions of the wind electricity supply shock identified in my working paper "Renewable energy supply shocks from wind electricity" for Germany.

Online access was a requirement for merging the shocks with German administrative data. 
If you would like to use this data, please send me an email at p.h.patzelt@lse.ac.uk and make sure to cite the paper.
